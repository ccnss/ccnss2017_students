    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will generate data from a linear-Gaussian state space model (LG-SSM), and solve it by different exact and approximate methods. Then we'll introduce a hierarchical model (a \"Double Kalman Filter\"), a model that was used a.o. in Behrens et al. 2007 to model how people assess volatility in their environment and adjust reward-based decisions accordingly. You've seen this paper referenced in several talks during the summer school (some of you even collected data using a similar model), and this tutorial will give you an opportunity to learn to fit the data using the actual (or assumed) generative model.\n",

In neuroscience it has been used to model navigation, motor control, reward learning, and a range of other phenomena.\n",

Experiment with different discretizations, to see how many points you have to use in the interval to get a good result and produce some plots comparing your estimates for $z_t$ with the ground truth.

When this is not the case, alternative approximate approaches may still be used. We implemented a naive, brute force approach in Ex.1. This time around we'll do something a bit smarter, and implement a sampling based method called particle filtering. Instead of specifying whole distributions, we will take a sample (particle) from the prior, follow it around as it evolves during using the generative model, and specify the new posterior using the resulting particles and weights.\n",

    "One possible extension to our original generative model is to account for the case when the variance in the transition dynamics is not constant. Many variables in the environment, and in the brain, can go through different phases of volatility. A simple way to model this is to have the variance of the transition model itself vary from timestep to timestep. In the double KF we implement this variance itself is the output of a hidden LG-SSM. This hierarchical model is no longer analytically solvable, however we can still implement our two approximations from above. As mentioned in the intro, a similar model was used by Behrens and colleagues to model how people make inferences about the reward structure in the environment, to adjust their learning rate (the equivalent of the Kalman Gain in Ex.3).\n",

It should be mentioned that neither of these solution methods is particularly elegant or effective once the dimensionality of that state space starts increasing, as in this example. For an easier problem (for the algorithm to solve, not necessarily to implement), you could go directly to implementing a solution to the Behrens et al. example, which is an optional exercise below. \n",
